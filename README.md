# EDA_AIRLINE_CUSTOMER_CHURN_DATA

This repository contains the analysis of an airline passenger satisfaction survey dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective of the project is to identify factors that are highly correlated to passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The repository includes an analysis notebook and a presentation of the findings.

Project Overview
Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Content: This dataset contains responses from an airline passenger satisfaction survey. It includes various factors related to passengers' experiences.
Objectives
Identify factors that contribute to passenger dissatisfaction or neutrality.
Understand the distribution and patterns in the satisfaction ratings.
Explore the relationships between different variables and passenger satisfaction.
Analysis Levels
Level 0: Understanding of Data

Visual inspection of the data.
Checking the shape of the data frame.
Identifying null values and cross-checking column names with the data dictionary.
Level 1: Univariate Analysis

Analyzing individual variables to understand their distribution and characteristics.
Checking for missing values and determining the appropriate graphical representation.
Level 2: Bivariate Analysis

Examining the relationships between two variables to identify significant associations.
Focusing on dissatisfied or neutral passengers vs. various factors such as gender, loyalty, travel type, and class.
Level 3: Multivariate Analysis

Investigating more complex relationships involving multiple variables.
Understanding how different factors collectively impact passenger satisfaction.
Key Findings
A significant portion of passengers are dissatisfied or neutral.
Dissatisfied passengers are more common in Economy and Economy Plus classes.
Personal travel passengers tend to be more dissatisfied compared to business travelers.
Departure and arrival time delays do not significantly affect passenger satisfaction.
Food and drink ratings are generally low across all classes, which might contribute to dissatisfaction.
Conclusion
The analysis reveals that most dissatisfied passengers travel in Economy or Economy Plus classes and that personal travel passengers show higher dissatisfaction rates. Business travel passengers also exhibit notable dissatisfaction, especially with business class services. Factors like food and drink quality appear to influence overall satisfaction significantly.
